# Critical Issue Report: Modal Overlap Problem

## Status: BLOCKED - Needs Investigation

## Problem Summary
The Industry Auth modal and 2FA modal are overlapping, with the Industry Auth modal intercepting pointer events and preventing user interaction with the 2FA modal.

## What We've Tried (All Failed)
1. ✗ JavaScript-based hiding in `open2FAModal()` function
2. ✗ JavaScript-based hiding in `openModal()` method
3. ✗ CSS `:has()` selector approach
4. ✗ Inline styles with `!important` 
5. ✗ Direct DOM manipulation in `openModal()`
6. ✗ Adding `modal-open` class to body
7. ✗ Global CSS styles with `is:global`

## Root Cause Discovered
**The 2FA modal is being opened through an UNKNOWN mechanism**

Evidence:
- None of our debug logs appear when the modal opens
- `handleLogin` function is never called
- `open2FAModal` function is never called  
- `openModal` method is never called
- Yet the 2FA modal DOES open successfully

## What This Means
There must be another script, component, or mechanism that is:
1. Listening to the "Access Dashboard" button click
2. Opening the 2FA modal directly
3. NOT using any of the standard functions we've been modifying

## Next Steps Required
1. Find ALL scripts that might be handling the button click
2. Find ALL code that manipulates the 2FA modal visibility
3. Identify which mechanism is actually being used
4. Apply the hiding logic to the CORRECT location

## Test Results
```
Industry Auth modal STILL intercepting pointer events
2FA modal IS visible
Cannot click buttons in 2FA modal
Z-index: Industry Auth (50), 2FA (50 - not updated to 100)
```

## Files Modified (But Not Working)
- `src/components/auth/2FAModal.astro` - openModal() method
- `src/components/auth/IndustryAuth.astro` - handleLogin handler
- CSS rules added but not effective

## Recommendation
We need to:
1. Search for ALL event listeners on `#login-btn`
2. Search for ALL code that removes `hidden` class from `#2fa-modal`
3. Find where the actual modal opening is happening
4. Apply our fixes there instead
