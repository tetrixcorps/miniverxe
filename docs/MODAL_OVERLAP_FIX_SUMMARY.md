# Modal Overlap Issue - Investigation Summary

## Problem
The Industry Auth modal and 2FA modal are overlapping, both visible at the same time with z-index 50, preventing proper user interaction.

## Key Findings

### From Terminal Logs:
1. **Both modals have z-index: 50** - they're overlapping
2. **Industry Auth modal is NOT being hidden** when 2FA modal opens
3. **Debug logs are NOT appearing** - JavaScript event handlers are not being called
4. **2FA modal IS opening** - but through an unknown mechanism

### From Web Search:
1. Use unique z-index values for each modal (Industry Auth: 50, 2FA: 100+)
2. Use both `hidden` class AND `display: none` for maximum compatibility
3. Ensure only one modal is visible at a time
4. Prevent background scrolling when modal is open
5. Implement focus management and trap focus within active modal

## Solution

### 1. Fix Z-Index Conflicts
- Industry Auth modal: z-50 (keep existing)
- 2FA modal: z-[100] (already updated)

### 2. Fix Modal Hiding
The issue is that the JavaScript event handlers are not being called. This suggests:
- Script loading order issue
- Event listener not being attached
- Different mechanism opening the 2FA modal

### 3. Direct DOM Manipulation
Since the JavaScript handlers aren't working, we need to use CSS to ensure only one modal is visible:
- Use higher z-index for 2FA modal
- Add `pointer-events: none` to Industry Auth modal when 2FA is visible
- Use CSS to hide Industry Auth modal when 2FA modal is visible

## Next Steps
1. Add CSS rules to handle modal stacking
2. Use `!important` to override inline styles if needed
3. Add pointer-events management
4. Test with Playwright to verify fix
