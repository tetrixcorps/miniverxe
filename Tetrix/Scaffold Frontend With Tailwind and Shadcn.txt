Great, the Vite server is now running and the previous build issues are resolved!  
However, the page is blank, which suggests the frontend either has no content or is missing a proper scaffold.

## Plan: Scaffold a React Frontend with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui

### 1. **Assess Current State**
- Check if there is an existing `src/App.tsx` and `src/main.tsx` in `apps/web`.
- Check if Tailwind CSS is already configured (it appears to be, based on the presence of `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`).
- Check if shadcn/ui is installed and configured.

### 2. **Scaffold/Replace as Needed**
- If `src/App.tsx` is empty or minimal, scaffold a basic layout using shadcn/ui components and Tailwind.
- Ensure the main entry (`src/main.tsx`) renders `App`.
- Add a simple navigation/header and a welcome section to verify everything is wired up.

### 3. **Testing**
- Confirm the page renders with visible content and shadcn/ui + Tailwind styles.

### **Assumptions & Questions**
- Do you want to keep any existing code in `apps/web/src`, or is it safe to overwrite with a new scaffold?
- Should we use TypeScript for all new files (recommended)?
- Do you want a specific layout or just a basic landing page with a header and a button?

**Next Step:**  
I will check the contents of `apps/web/src/App.tsx` and `apps/web/src/main.tsx` to determine the current state and then propose the right scaffold.

Does that sound good, or do you have any preferences for the initial layout or components?
