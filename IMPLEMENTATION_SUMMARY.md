## Technical Architecture

### RBAC Flow
```
User Login â†’ Firebase Auth â†’ User Claims â†’ Role Assignment â†’ Permission Check â†’ Access Control
```

### Rate Limiting Flow
```
Request â†’ Redis Check â†’ Rate Limit Validation â†’ Request Processing â†’ Response
```

### User Group Structure
```
SuperAdmin (All Permissions)
â”œâ”€â”€ Data Annotators
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TaskAdmin (Project Management)
